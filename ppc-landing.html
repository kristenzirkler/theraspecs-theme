<h2>Natural Migraine Relief with TheraSpecs Migraine Sunlasses</h2>
<p>Research shows TheraSpecs&reg; <strong>migraine glasses</strong> and <strong>migraine sunglasses</strong> relieve painful light sensitivity better than regular sunglasses and also <strong>reduce the number of migraine attacks</strong> all without the cost and side effects associated with medications. A clinical study of TheraSpecs tint showed that participants went from an average of 6.2 to 1.6 migraine attacks per month&mdash;that&rsquo;s a 74% reduction in attacks!</p>
