        <p>"I popped my TheraSpecs on as soon as I got the box and the first word that came out of my mouth was "ahhhh!" They are amazingly lightweight and the wrap-around design really blocks light from the sides. I will be wearing them all the time indoors! TheraSpecs are a small miracle for this chronic migraineur!"</p>

        <p>"TheraSpecs have truly been a life saver for me. Iâ€™ve gone from barely being able to work 4 hours in a day and then needing to pass out on the couch to being able to work 10 hours without any effect. After having a migraine every day for 6 months I have finally been without pain. Wow!"</p>
